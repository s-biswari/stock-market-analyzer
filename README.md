# stock-market-analyzer

A robust, multithreaded Spring Boot application for real-time and historical stock market data aggregation, analytics, and strategy simulation. Designed for flexibility, performance, and extensibility, this project demonstrates concurrent data fetching, analytics computation, and export capabilitiesâ€”all with a modern REST API and interactive documentation.

## Key Features
- **Concurrent Data Fetching:** Efficiently fetches real-time and historical stock data for multiple symbols in parallel using a thread pool (ExecutorService).
- **Customizable Analytics:** Calculates moving averages, volatility, and simulates a simple moving average trading strategy. All analytics periods are user-configurable per request.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Gracefully manages API rate limits, network errors, and invalid symbols.
- **Flexible Output:** Results can be returned as JSON, or exported as CSV or Excel (XLSX) files for further analysis or reporting.
- **Interactive API Documentation:** Integrated Swagger UI (OpenAPI) for easy exploration and testing of all endpoints.
- **Modern Java & Spring Boot:** Built with Java 17 and Spring Boot 3.x for maximum compatibility and maintainability.

## Getting Started

- **Build:** `./mvnw clean package`
- **Run:** `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
- **Java Version:** 17
- **Spring Boot:** 3.x
